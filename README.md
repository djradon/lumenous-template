This repo contains:

- **/lumenous-template**: a content-free and somewhat de-branded version of the
  beautiful and functional [https://lume.land](https://lume.land/) website
  layouts, styles and templates (MIT Licensed, copyright
  [Óscar Otero](https://oscarotero.com/))
- **/demo**: a little documentation and some placeholder content to demonstrate
  the template
- **/lume**: a lume configuration (_config.ts) and accompanying deno.json config
  that demonstrate lumeMultiSource, a way to generate a single site from content
  spread across multiple repos (and branches)
- **/docs**: the result of combining the above, servable by classic github pages

If you use the lumenous-template, especially in a commercial capacity, please
[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/oscarotero) or otherwise compensate Óscar!

Any technical or aesthetic flaws in the template are likely my fault, so please
don't bother Óscar about them.
